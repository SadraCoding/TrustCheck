## What is a Honeypot?

A honeypot token is a malicious smart contract engineered to deceive investors. Users can buy these tokens, but they are prevented from selling them. The contract code contains hidden restrictions that only allow whitelisted addresses (typically the creator's) to sell, leaving other investors' funds locked.
